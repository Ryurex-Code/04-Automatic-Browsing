===========================
 How to Run for First Time
===========================

📌 This file contains step-by-step instructions to help you set up the Bing Auto Search Tool correctly BEFORE running it the first time.

----------------------------
🔧 1. Edit the .env File
----------------------------

FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT: You must edit the .env file with your personal information.

📍 Open the .env file in this folder and replace the placeholder values:

BEFORE (default content):
    YOUR_USERNAME=<<YOUR USERNAME>>
    TOTAL_PROFILES=<<TOTAL PROFILES>>

AFTER (with your actual values):
    YOUR_USERNAME=JohnDoe
    TOTAL_PROFILES=5

🔍 How to find YOUR USERNAME:
1. Press `Windows + R`
2. Type: `cmd` → press Enter
3. In the terminal, type: `echo %USERNAME%`

OR you can check it by opening File Explorer → go to C:\Users\ → your username is one of the folder names

OR search "edge://version/" in Microsoft Edge address bar and look at the Profile Path

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
- Remove the << and >> symbols completely
- Use your exact Windows username (case sensitive)
- No quotes around the values
- Set TOTAL_PROFILES to match how many Edge profiles you plan to create

----------------------------
⚙️  2. Create Edge Profiles
----------------------------

You must open Microsoft Edge and manually create multiple profiles.

📍 To create a profile:
1. Open Microsoft Edge.
2. Click on your profile icon (top right).
3. Click "Add Profile" → "Add".
4. Sign in with a Microsoft account (important for Bing rewards or syncing).

📝 Recommended: Create them as "Profile 1", "Profile 2", etc.

🔢 Make sure the number of profiles you create matches the TOTAL_PROFILES value in your .env file.

Example:
- If you set TOTAL_PROFILES=5 in .env, create exactly 5 profiles in Edge
- If you only want to use 3 profiles, set TOTAL_PROFILES=3 in .env

These profiles will be used and controlled by Selenium WebDriver.

----------------------------------------------------
📁 3. Verify Your Edge Profile Path
----------------------------------------------------

The script will automatically use your username from the .env file to build this path:

    C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Ryurex Project

📌 To verify this is correct:
1. Open Microsoft Edge
2. Type "edge://version/" in the address bar
3. Look at the "Profile Path" - it should contain your username

❗ Make sure the Edge profiles you created actually exist in this location.

------------------------------------------------
🧪 4. Disable Headless Mode on First-Time Setup
------------------------------------------------

When you run the script for the first time, make sure to disable headless mode so you can:
- Manually sign into each Microsoft Edge profile
- Verify access to Bing and confirm sessions are saved
- See any potential errors or issues

📍 The script will ask:
    Do you want to inactivate headless mode (Y/N):

Type: Y

✅ Once all profiles are configured correctly and sessions saved, you may run in headless mode next time (just press N or Enter).

-------------------
🚀 5. First Run
-------------------

Once you've completed steps 1-4:

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python search-tool.py
   ```
   OR double-click `click-here.bat`

2. When prompted:
   - "Do you want to inactivate headless mode (Y/N):" → Type Y
   - "Do you want to show detailed information (Y/N):" → Type Y (recommended for first run)

3. The script will open Edge browsers for each profile
4. Make sure each profile is properly signed in to Microsoft account
5. Let the script complete at least one full cycle

-------------------
⚠️ Troubleshooting
-------------------

If you get errors:

❌ "YOUR_USERNAME not found in .env file!"
   → You didn't edit the .env file or left <<YOUR USERNAME>> unchanged

❌ "Profile directory not found"
   → Your username in .env doesn't match your actual Windows username
   → Check the username is spelled correctly (case sensitive)

❌ WebDriver errors
   → Make sure Microsoft Edge WebDriver is installed and matches your Edge version
   → Place msedgedriver.exe in the same folder as search-tool.py

❌ "Profile 1 not found" etc.
   → You didn't create enough profiles in Edge
   → Reduce TOTAL_PROFILES in .env to match actual profiles created

-------------------
✅ You're all set!
-------------------

After successful first-time setup, future runs can use headless mode for faster, background operation.

Enjoy your automated Bing searching experience!

💡 Tip: Keep the .env file private and never share it, as it contains your personal system information.
