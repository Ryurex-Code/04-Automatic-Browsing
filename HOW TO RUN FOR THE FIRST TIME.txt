 How to Run for First Time
===========================

📌 This file contains step-by-step instructions to help you set up the Bing Auto Search Tool correctly BEFORE running it the first time.

----------------------------
⚙️  1. Create Edge Profiles
----------------------------

You must open Microsoft Edge and manually create multiple profiles.

📍 To create a profile:
1. Open Microsoft Edge.
2. Click on your profile icon (top right).
3. Click "Add Profile" → "Add".
4. Sign in with a Microsoft account (important for Bing rewards or syncing).

📝 Recommended: Create them as "Profile 1", "Profile 2", etc.

These profiles will be used and controlled by Selenium WebDriver.

----------------------------------------
🧑‍💻 2. Match Profile Count in the Script
----------------------------------------

Open `search-tool.py` or `app.py`, and find this line:

    total_profiles = 7

Change the value based on how many profiles you've created in Edge.

Example:
- If you only created 5 profiles, change it to:

      total_profiles = 5

----------------------------------------------------
📁 3. Set Your Edge Profile Folder (--user-data-dir)
----------------------------------------------------

Locate your Edge user data folder on Windows. Here's how:

🔍 How to find YOUR USERNAME:
1. Press `Windows + R`
2. Type: `cmd` → press Enter
3. In the terminal, type: `echo %USERNAME%`

or you can check it by Microsoft Edge with just search "edge://version/" on your search bar.

Then use this in the following path:

    C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Ryurex Project

📌 In your script (`search-tool.py`), update this line:

    options.add_argument(r"--user-data-dir=C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Ryurex Project")

❗ Make sure the directory and profile folders EXIST before running the tool.

------------------------------------------------
🧪 4. Disable Headless Mode on First-Time Setup
------------------------------------------------

When you run the script for the first time, make sure to disable headless mode so you can:
- Manually sign into each Microsoft Edge profile in Edge Web Driver
- Verify access to Bing and confirm session is saved

📍 The script will ask:
    Do you want to inactivate headless mode (Y/N):

Type: Y

✅ Once all profiles are configured correctly and sessions saved, you may run in headless mode next time (just press N or Enter).

-------------------
✅ You're all set!
-------------------

Once setup is complete, you can run:

    python search-tool.py

Or double-click `click-here.bat`

Enjoy your automated Bing searching experience!
