## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- **Python 3.x**  
  Download: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- **Microsoft Edge Browser**  
  Download: [https://www.microsoft.com/edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)

- **Microsoft Edge WebDriver** (must match your Edge version)  
  Download: [https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/)

- **Python Libraries** (installed automatically via `.bat` or manually via pip):
```bash
pip install selenium win10toast tqdm
```

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Microsoft Edge WebDriver Installation

Selenium needs a **WebDriver** to control your Edge browser. Here's how to set it up:

### 1. Check Your Edge Browser Version

Open Microsoft Edge and go to `edge://settings/help`. Note the version number (e.g., `125.0.2535.92`).

### 2. Download the Correct WebDriver

Visit the official page: [Microsoft Edge WebDriver](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/)

Download the `msedgedriver.zip` that matches your Edge version.

### 3. Extract the WebDriver

Extract the `msedgedriver.exe` from the ZIP file.

### 4. Place the WebDriver Executable

* **Option A (Recommended):**
  Put `msedgedriver.exe` in the same folder as `app.py`

* **Option B (Advanced):**
  Add the WebDriver directory to your system PATH:

```text
1. Search "Environment Variables"
2. Edit system environment variables ‚Üí Environment Variables‚Ä¶
3. Under "System variables", find "Path" ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí New
4. Paste your WebDriver folder path (e.g., C:\WebDrivers\)
5. Click OK, restart terminal if needed
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Initial Setup Before First Run

‚ùó **Important:** Before you run the script for the first time, make sure to:
‚ö†Ô∏è Feel free to modificated the script based on your purpose. 

1. **Create Edge Profiles (Required Before First Run)**  
   You must first open Microsoft Edge and manually create profiles (e.g., Profile 1, Profile 2, etc.) and sign in to your Microsoft account on each. These will be the profiles used by Selenium.

2. **Match Profile Count in Script**  
   Make sure the number of profiles created matches the `total_profiles` value in the script:
   ```python
   total_profiles = 7
   ```
   If you create fewer profiles, reduce this value to prevent errors.

3. **Set Your Profile Folder Path**  
   Update this line <YOUR_USERNAME> to match your actual Edge user data folder:
   ```python
   options.add_argument(r"--user-data-dir=C:\\Users\\<YOUR_USERNAME>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data\\Ryurex Project")
   ```

5. **Disable Headless Mode on First Run**  
   On your very first execution, answer:
   ```
   Do you want to inactivate headless mode (Y/N): Y
   ```
   This allows you to see and configure each Edge profile manually (e.g., sign in, verify account access).  
   After setup is complete, you may run in headless mode safely.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

You can launch the script by running:

```bash
python search-tool.py
```

Or just double-click `click-here.bat`

You will be asked:

- Whether to disable headless mode (browser visibility)
- Whether to show detailed info (keywords, delay)

The tool will loop through each profile and perform:

* 30 desktop + 20 mobile Bing searches (with iPhone X emulation for mobile)
