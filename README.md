## üåü Introduction

Welcome to the **Bing Auto Search Tool V1.0**! This simple yet effective Python-based automation script performs automated searches on Bing.com. Using the **Selenium** library, it simulates human interaction to navigate, input queries, and submit them. This tool is perfect for automating repetitive search tasks or for educational purposes to understand basic web automation.

Developed by **Muhammad Rafi (Ryurex)** in collaboration with **Chisato Nishikigi**, this tool streamlines your search automation needs.

## üìÇ Project Structure

This repository contains two main files:

* **`app.py`**: This is the core Python script. It initializes the Edge WebDriver, defines the list of search keywords, navigates to Bing.com, inputs the keywords into the search bar, and submits the queries. It also includes `win10toast` for desktop notifications upon completion.
* **`click-here.bat`**: A convenient Windows batch script designed to simplify the execution process. It automatically checks for and installs the necessary Python libraries (`selenium` and `win10toast`) if they're not already installed, then proceeds to run the `app.py` script.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Before you can run this tool, please ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Python 3.x**: This script is written in Python. We recommend using Python 3.8 or newer. You can download the latest version from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* **Microsoft Edge Browser**: The script specifically uses the Edge WebDriver. Please ensure you have Microsoft Edge installed on your Windows operating system.
* **Microsoft Edge WebDriver**: Selenium requires a WebDriver to interface with the browser. You'll need the `msedgedriver.exe` executable, and its version must match your installed Microsoft Edge browser version.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Microsoft Edge WebDriver Installation

Selenium needs a **WebDriver** to control your Edge browser. Here's how to set it up:

### 1. Check Your Edge Browser Version

Open Microsoft Edge, type `edge://settings/help` in the address bar, and press Enter. Make a note of your browser's **version number** (e.g., `125.0.2535.92`).

### 2. Download the Correct WebDriver

Visit the official Microsoft Edge WebDriver page: [https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/). **Download the `msedgedriver.zip` file that precisely matches your Edge browser's version.**

### 3. Extract the WebDriver

Once downloaded, locate the `.zip` file and **extract the `msedgedriver.exe` file** from it.

### 4. Place the WebDriver Executable

You have two simple options for placing the `msedgedriver.exe` file:

* **Option A (Recommended for simplicity)**:
    Just put the extracted `msedgedriver.exe` file into the **same directory as your `app.py` script**. This is the easiest way for this project.

* **Option B (For System-wide Access)**:
    Place `msedgedriver.exe` into a dedicated folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Edge\edgedriver_win64\`). Then, add this folder's path to your system's `PATH` environment variable. This lets you run `msedgedriver.exe` from any directory.

    **How to add to PATH:**
    1.  Search for "Environment Variables" in the Windows search bar and select "Edit the system environment variables".
    2.  Click the "Environment Variables..." button.
    3.  Under "System variables", find and select the "Path" variable, then click "Edit...".
    4.  Click "New" and paste the full path to your WebDriver folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Edge\edgedriver_win64\`).
    5.  Click "OK" on all open windows to save the changes. You might need to restart your command prompt or IDE for changes to take effect.

## üì¶ Python Packages

This project relies on the following Python libraries. While the `click-here.bat` script will attempt to install them, you can also install them manually using `pip`:

* **`selenium`**: A powerful library for automating web browsers.
    * Installation via pip:
        ```bash
        pip install selenium
        ```
    * PyPI Project Page: [https://pypi.org/project/selenium/](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)
* **`win10toast`**: A simple library to send Windows 10 toast notifications.
    * Installation via pip:
        ```bash
        pip install win10toast
        ```
    * PyPI Project Page: [https://pypi.org/project/win10toast/](https://pypi.org/project/win10toast/)

## üöÄ How to Use

Follow these steps to set up and run the Bing Auto Search Tool:

1.  **Obtain the Project Files:**
    You can either clone this repository to your local machine using Git, or simply download the ZIP file and extract its contents.

2.  **Ensure Microsoft Edge WebDriver is Installed:**
    This is a critical step for Selenium to work with your Edge browser. Please ensure you've followed the "Microsoft Edge WebDriver Installation" steps above to correctly place and make `msedgedriver.exe` accessible.

3.  **Run the Tool:**
    Navigate to the project directory (where `app.py` and `click-here.bat` are located) in your File Explorer. Simply **double-click** the `click-here.bat` file.

    The batch script will then:
    * Check for and install the required Python libraries (`selenium` and `win10toast`).
    * Launch the `app.py` script.
    * Open a command prompt window to display the search progress.
    * Perform automated searches using Microsoft Edge in **headless mode** (the browser window will run in the background and not be visibly open).
    * Send a Windows toast notification to your desktop once all searches are completed.

---

## üìå Notes

* The script is configured to perform **30 searches**. You can modify the `total_searches` variable in `app.py` if you wish to change this number.
* The `time.sleep(10)` function in `app.py` introduces a 10-second delay between each search to allow the page to fully load and to avoid potential issues with rapid requests. You can adjust this value if needed, but be mindful of rate limits or bot detection by Bing.
* The browser runs in **headless mode** (`--headless=new`). This means the browser window will not be visible, running purely in the background. This is efficient for automation tasks.
* This tool is intended for educational, demonstration, and automation testing purposes.
* Please avoid abusing search engines or using this for unauthorized scraping.
